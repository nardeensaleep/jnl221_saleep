		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/" target="_blank">Women's pockets</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics</li>
			<li><a href="https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/#" target="_blank">Building collapses in Egypt</a>, <a href="https://alternative-narratives-vis-archive.com/case_studies/egypt-building-collapses" target="_blank">Tactical Technology Collective</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Egypt Building Collapses</h3>
		<p>I chose the Egypt Building Collapses dataviz project. The data for the project was collected by the Shadow Ministry of Housing and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. The dataviz used images more than one of the readerâ€™s senses, which is very effective for what this project is. It opens with a short paragraph giving context about building collapses in Egypt in English and in Arabic. Once you choose a language, it takes you to a recording of sounds of building collapses and an explanation of the recording as dataviz, in that every second represents two days. The circles showing collapses, injured, dead, and homeless families slowly gain more circles around the outside to represent each person or family. The key at the bottom shows the cause of each collapse in two categories and eight subcategories. However, adding up the number of collapses at the bottom, I constantly got 382, yet the circle says 392. This was a bit confusing because it is kind of like a pie chart that does not add up to 100%. </p>
		<p>The key message of the dataviz project is that a lack of government regulation and bad planning leads to building collapses, which causes great harm to hundreds of people. The project is very effective in conveying this because it is very simple. The two main causes given are lack of government regulation and bad planning, which are explained when hovering over them. Additionally, they are broken down into eight specific subcategories under these two causes, and each subcategory is explained when the reader hovers over it as well. There is no other information provided, which in some ways made the project feel a bit incomplete for me since there is no article, but it also made the message very clear. </p>
		<p>This dataviz project is definitely visceral. It is very emotional and conveys the humanity of the data they found. The sounds of the building collapses are not too hard to listen to so as not to turn away the reader, but just emotional enough to convery how sad of a situation this is. The sounds are definitely the most visceral element of the project. The picture in the background of the collapsed building also adds to what the producers of the project are trying to convey. It pulls the reader into the world the creators are discussing. </p>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: -->
		<iframe title="Serbia has the highest U.S. active troop presence " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-1FaEG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1FaEG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="428"></iframe>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
